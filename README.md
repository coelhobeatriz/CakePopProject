# CakePopProject

CakePop aims to be a joyful desktop application built in Java using Object-Oriented Programming and Java Swing, designed to automate birthday celebrations with flair. 
Users can register names and birthdates, which are stored persistently. 
Each day, the app checks for birthdays and, if a match is found, it generates a personalized animated birthday card featuring a cake, the celebrant’s name, and their age in a festive design.

**What makes CakePop extra special?** It doesn’t just show the card—it automatically sends it via WhatsApp to the birthday person using an integrated messaging API. This ensures that birthday wishes are delivered directly and delightfully, without any manual effort.

The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and uses scheduled tasks to perform daily checks. With Swing animations and WhatsApp integration, CakePop brings celebration and connectivity together.
